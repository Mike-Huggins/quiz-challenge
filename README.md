# Quiz Challenge

Your challenge is to make an object-oriented quiz game using TDD and the following user stories.

There's no right or wrong way to solve the problem, the main challenge is to make a system by yourself without a walkthrough (although you should definitely not be shy about asking questions to your cohort etc!)

To get started **fork** this repository and clone the fork to your computer.

Remember to practice domain modelling, write your tests first, experiment in the Node CLI and commit your work regularly. Once you've finished, make a pull request back to this repo for us to give you feedback!
